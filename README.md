Open Screenshots and upload to ULAPPH Cloud Desktop
--

This is a cloned repo of https://github.com/AminaG/OpenScreenshot which I have modified so it will upload screenshots to ULAPPH Cloud Desktop. Only the manifest and editor.html was modified. If you own an ULAPPH Cloud Desktop server, you can download this extension and install to your Chrome browser. 

Install & Setup
--

Update the editor.html file to contain your ULAPPH Cloud Desktop server. Then, go to Extensions/Developer mode of Chrome browser and install this chrome extension.
